<h3>Cough and Cold Medicines</h3><br>


<h4>Should I take a decongestant or an antihistamine?</h4>
<p>It depends on what's bothering you. If your nose and sinuses are stuffed up, a decongestant may help. You can use it alone or combine it with an antihistamine. Remember, though, it can increase your heart rate and may cause anxiety or make it hard to fall asleep.
</p>
<p>
If you have a runny nose or sneezing, try an antihistamine. Some types may have diphenhydramine, which can make you drowsy. Be careful if you need to drive or use machinery. You can also try non-sedating antihistamines, which don't make you as sleepy.
</p>
<p>
Dry mouth is another common side effect of antihistamines.
</p>
<h4>Is it safe to take a decongestant if I have high blood pressure?</h4>
<p>
Decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine, can raise your blood pressure and heart rate. If you have high blood pressure, it's a good idea to check with your doctor or pharmacist to find out what's right for you.
</p>
<p>
You can also try decongestant-free cold medicines, such as Coricidin HBP.
</p>

<h4>How often can I use nasal sprays for congestion?</h4>
<p>
They work fast to open up your clogged nose. But if you use them for more than 3 days in a row, you may end up more stuffed up than you were before. Doctors call this the "rebound effect."
</p>
<p>
Some side effects of nasal decongestants are having a hard time falling asleep, restlessness, and trouble peeing.
</p>
<p>
You might try a saline spray instead of a nasal decongestant. It works more slowly, but it can loosen up the mucus in your nose without a rebound effect.
</p>

<h4>What's the deal with cough syrup and medicine?</h4>
<p>
Not all doctors agree about the best way to treat a cough. Some don't think cough medicines are that effective.
</p>
There are three common types of over-the-counter cough and cold medicines:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Cough suppressantsM</li>
<li>Oral expectorants</li>
<li>Topical (creams or gels you put on your skin)</li>
</ul>
<p>
They can be used to either stop your cough or loosen thick mucus to help you cough it up. When that's not enough, your doctor may prescribe a strong prescription cough medicine.
</p>

<h4>What cold medicine should I take for a fever and aches?</h4>
<p>
A fever may be a good thing. It helps fight off an infection by curbing the growth of bacteria and viruses and activating the immune system, your body's defense against germs. Doctors no longer recommend trying to lower a fever, except for young kids, the elderly, and people with certain medical conditions such as heart disease or lung disease.
</p>
<p>
If your fever makes you uncomfortable, though, it's fine to take medicine for it. Young people, including those in their early 20s, should avoid aspirin. Acetaminophen or other medicines like ibuprofen are your best choices.
</p>
<p>
Each medication has its own risks, so check with your doctor to see which is best for you. Be careful not to overdose. These drugs are often mixed in with other cough and cold medicines you may also be taking. Your pharmacist can help you make the right choice.
</p>
<p>
If you have severe body aches or a fever over 102 degrees, you may have the flu. Call your doctor to see if you need flu medicine or if something else might be causing your symptoms.
</p>
<h4>What's the best medicine for my sore throat?</h4>
<p>
You can get some relief if you drink lots of fluids and gargle with salt water. Mix up a batch by combining a cup of warm water and a teaspoon of salt.
</p>
<p>
Acetaminophen or medicated lozenges and gargles can also temporarily soothe your sore throat. But see your doctor if you have a fever, a lot of pain, or you find it hard to swallow. You may have strep throat and need antibiotics.
</p>

<h4>Are combination cold medicines effective?</h4>
<p>
Many people get relief from them. These drugs often contain a pain reliever, a cough suppressant, and an expectorant that loosens up your mucus and makes it easier to cough it up. They also often have either a decongestant or an antihistamine.
</p>
<p>
Since decongestants can keep you awake, they are usually in "daytime" multi-symptom cold medicines. Antihistamines, which can make you sleepy, are in "nighttime" versions.
</p>
<p>
If you try a combination cold medicine, make sure you can safely use the specific ingredients. For instance, if you have high blood pressure or heart disease, avoid ones that have decongestants, which can make those conditions worse. If you have asthma or emphysema, talk to your doctor before taking one that has a cough suppressant.
</p>

<h4>How effective are natural cold remedies like zinc, echinacea, and vitamin C?</h4>

<p>
Some early research suggests that zinc may ease your symptoms and shorten your cold. But other studies show that it doesn't work any better than a placebo ("dummy pill"). Also, the FDA warns that several zinc nasal sprays have been linked to a permanent loss of smell. For all these reasons, the side effects from zinc may outweigh any possible benefits.
</p>

<p>
Studies on echinacea are mixed. Some show some benefit in treating your cold while others show it doesn't help.
</p>
<p>
As for vitamin C, recent research shows it may only help prevent colds in certain people, such as those who do vigorous exercise in extreme environments.
</p>
<p>
There's some evidence that it may shorten how long you have a cold. One large study found that people who took a vitamin C megadose -- 8 grams on the first day they got sick-- shortened the length of their cold.
</p>
<p>
To avoid colds the natural way, it's best to make sure you've got a well-nourished immune system. Experts say a diet rich in fruits and vegetablescan help you ward off infections like colds and the flu.
</p>
<p>
To keep healthy, try to eat the recommended dietary allowance of vitamins, and minerals.
Regular exercise can also boost the immune system. People who do that still catch a virus, but they may have less-severe symptoms. They may also recover more quickly compared with less-healthy people.
</p>
<h4>Can antibiotics treat a cold?</h4>
<p>
These medications only work against illnesses caused by bacteria, and colds are caused by viruses.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, an infection with bacteria can follow the cold virus. For example, you might get a sinus infection that lingers days after the cold is over. If that's the case, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. 
</p>
<h4>Are kids' cold medicines safe?</h4>
<p>
Children have special needs when it comes to cold medicine. Don't give over-the-counter cough and cold drugs to children under 4. Although kids' cold medicines may still be on the shelves at your drugstore, talk to your child's doctor before using them.
</p>
<p>
Never give children age 18 or younger any product with aspirin unless your doctor has specifically told you to. Aspirin given to children with symptoms of a cold, the flu, or chickenpox can cause a rare but sometimes deadly condition called Reye's syndrome.

<h2>FAQ:</h2> 
<h3>Common Cold</h3>

<h4>What's the difference between a cold and the flu?</h4>

<p>These illnesses are caused by different viruses. They have similar symptoms, so it can be hard to tell them apart. In general, cold symptoms are much milder than flu symptoms.</p>

The symptoms of a cold include things like:
<ul>
<li>Sore throat</li>
<li>Stuffy nose</li>
<li>Runny nose</li>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Mild fever</li>
</ul>
<p>
The flu, on the other hand, often causes higher fever, chills, body aches, and fatigue.
</p>
<h4>Why isn't there a cold vaccine?</h4>
<p>
The cold can be caused by nearly 250 different viruses. It's just too hard for scientists to make a vaccine that protects you against all of them.
</p>
<p>
Also, from a medical point of view, there's less need to create a vaccinefor colds than other illnesses. Although you feel awful when you have one, they generally come and go without any serious complications. You're miserable for a few days, then it's over.
</p>
<h4>Could my cold symptoms actually be allergies?</h4>
<p>
It's possible, if you're sniffling but not achy or feverish.
Also, if your symptoms last longer than 2 weeks, and you also have red, itchy eyes, it might be allergies.
</p>
<p>But it's often hard to tell the difference because people with allergies and asthma are more likely to get colds. They may already have inflamed and irritated lungs, so they're less able to fight off a virus.
</p>
<h4>What's the best treatment for a cold?</h4>
<p>
The most important thing you can do is drink a lot of fluids to keep your body hydrated. This will help prevent another infection from setting in.
</p>
<p>
Avoid drinks with caffeine like coffee, tea, and colas. They may rob your body of fluids. When it comes to food, follow your appetite. If you're not really hungry, try simple things like white rice or broth.
</p>
<p>
Chicken soup is comforting, plus the steam helps break up nasal congestion. Ginger seems to settle an upset stomach. A hot toddy may help you sleep, but be careful about drinking alcohol if you also take cold remedies.
</p>
<br>
Over-the-counter medicines can give you relief from aches and fever:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Aspirin . People under age 20 should not take it because of the risk of Reye's syndrome.</li>
<li>Decongestants. They can help make breathing easier. But don't use sprays for more than 3 days because they can cause swelling in passageways in your nose and make your symptoms worse.</li>
<li>Saline nasal sprays. They can also open breathing passages and may be used freely.</li>
<li>Cough preparations. They aren'thugely effective. For minor coughs, water and fruit juices probably help the most. The FDA says that over-the-counter cough and cold medicines should not be given to children under age 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>	
For relief from a sore throat, try gargling with salt water.
</p>
<h4>How effective are natural remedies like zinc, echinacea, and vitamin C?</h4>
<p>
There are mixed reviews on zinc. Some studies show that zinc nasal sprays can help reduce how long your cold lasts and make your symptoms less severe.
</p>
<p>
The theory? Zinc sprays may coat the cold virus and prevent it from attaching to cells in your nose, where they enter your body.
Other studies show that zinc isn't helpful. And because of the risk of a loss of smell, many experts recommend that you avoid zinc nasal sprays completely.
</p>
<p>
Recent studies on echinacea show that it isn't helpful in preventing colds. But in one study, 120 people with cold-like symptoms took 20 drops of echinacea every 2 hours for 10 days and had briefer colds than others.
</p>
<p>
As for vitamin C, a recent look at 65 years of studies found limited benefit. The researchers saw no evidence that it prevents colds. But they did find signs that your colds might not last as long if you take vitamin C. One large study found that people who took a megadose -- 8 grams on the first day they got sick -- shortened the length of their colds.
</p>
<p>
To prevent colds the natural way, it's best to make sure you've got a well-nourished immune system, your body's defense against germs. Dark-green foods like spinach are loaded with vitamins A and C. Salmon is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, which fight inflammation. Low-fat yogurt may help activate the immune system.
</p>
<p>
Regular exercise also boosts the immune system. People who do it may still catch a virus, but their symptoms aren't as bad, and they may recover more quickly.
</p>

<h4>Should I get an antibiotic?</h4>
<p>
Antibiotics fight bacteria, but that won't help your cold, which is caused by a virus.
</p>
<p>But your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic if you have some complications. For instance, if your sinuses are blocked and can't drain properly, you can get inflammation and a bacterial infection. The symptoms may be a runny or stuffy nose, pain and pressure in your face, and a headache.
</p>
<p>Also, you can sometimes get an ear infection after a cold, and you might need antibiotics to treat it. Symptoms include ear pain, fever, or a feeling of fullness in the ears.
</p>
<h4>Should I stay at home if I have a cold?</h4>
<p>
You're contagious for the first few days of your cold, so it's best to stay home then. You need to be careful about coughing and sneezing around other people. Also, you will get better quicker if you get some rest.
</p>
<h4>How can I prevent a cold?</h4>
<p>Your best approach? Wash your hands. Both the flu and colds are passed around the same way. Someone sneezes or coughs, and tiny droplets with a virus are sprayed onto any nearby surface -- including you!
</p>
<p>If people cough or sneeze into their hands without a tissue, they can spread the virus to every surface they touch. If you touch that same spot, you'll pick it up. If you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, you've just infected yourself.
</p>
<br>
To protect yourself and prevent the spread of cold and flu viruses:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands frequently with soap and water. If you don't have that nearby, use an alcohol-based gel.</li>
<li>Cough and sneeze into a tissue.</li>
<li>No tissue? When you cough, turn your head away from others.</li>
<li>If you have a sudden sneeze, bend your arm and sneeze into it.</li>
<li>Don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.</li>
<li>Wash any shared surfaces, like phones and keyboards, frequently. Viruses can live on surfaces for several hours.</li>
<li>Stay away from crowds during cold and flu season.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Can you catch a cold from cold air?
</h4>
<p>
This is one of the most persistent myths about colds. The only way you get sick is when you come into contact with a virus.
</p>
<p>
Cold air may irritate a condition you already have, like asthma, which could make your body more receptive to a cold virus. But you still need to come in contact with the virus.
</p>

<h4>Why does my child always seem to have a cold?</h4>
<p>
Kids are incredibly good at passing around a virus. They naturally breathe out more highly concentrated virus droplets than adults do.
</p>
<p>
As every parent knows, children are very active, always in each other's faces. And of course, they may not wash their hands as often or as well as grown-ups.
